<div>I’m happy to share that I have successfully completed the “Digital Transformation with Google Cloud” course!
Through this program, I learned about cloud computing concepts, Google Cloud services, and how businesses use the cloud to grow and innovate.
This course helped me understand real-world applications of cloud technology and strengthened my interest in exploring cloud solutions further.

I would like to thank Simplilearn and Google Cloud for providing this valuable learning opportunity.
Excited to continue learning and building new skills in cloud computing!</div>

<div>I’m thrilled to share that I won 1st place in the “WebCraft 2025 HTML Hackathon”, a college-level competition focused on creative and functional website design using only HTML and CSS.

During the event, I developed a responsive portfolio website that showcased clean structure, simplicity, and user-friendly design — all built without advanced frameworks.

This experience helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and boosted my confidence in creating web pages from scratch. I’m grateful to my mentors and teammates for their constant support and encouragement.

Excited to explore more web development challenges ahead!</div>
